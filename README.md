Envato Avengers App landing page  
App Landing Page Naming convention

## Guidelines
- Use 90% Bootstrap
- Style Custom CLASSES, not Elements or BOOTSTRAP classes
- Use a Mobile-first approach (Your CSS should be for mobile-first before Tab and Desktop)
- DRY - Do not repeat yourself
- Use 4 media query breakpoints (recommended breakpoints are min-width of 576px, 768px, 992px, 1200px)
- Your pages must be RESPONSIVE!
- Your custom CSS classes have to be prefixed with the section you are working on. E.g for your header, instead of having a button class of btn, you can have btn-header or header-btn.
